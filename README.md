# Welcome to the AirBnB Clone Project!

Before you get started, please familiarize yourself with the [AirBnB concept page](https://www.airbnb.com/).

## Project Overview

Welcome to the first step of building your AirBnB clone project! This initial step is crucial as it lays the foundation for the entire project, including subsequent tasks such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

In this phase, you will be developing a command interpreter to manage various AirBnB objects. This command interpreter will enable you to perform essential operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects within the AirBnB environment.

## Project Objectives

Here's a breakdown of what you will accomplish in this step:

- Implement a parent class (BaseModel) responsible for initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.
- Establish a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
- Create classes for AirBnB entities (e.g., User, State, City, Place) that inherit from the BaseModel.
- Develop the first abstracted storage engine for the project: File storage.
- Write comprehensive unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.

## What's a Command Interpreter?

Think of the command interpreter as a specialized version of a shell, tailored to the specific needs of our project. With the command interpreter, you'll be able to perform the following tasks:

- Create new objects (e.g., User, Place).
- Retrieve objects from files, databases, etc.
- Perform operations on objects (e.g., count, compute statistics).
- Update attributes of existing objects.
- Destroy (delete) objects as needed.

## Getting Started

To begin, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the AirBnB clone project repository to your local machine.
2. **Read the Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the project requirements and guidelines provided in the documentation.
3. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured for development.
4. **Start Coding**: Begin implementing the command interpreter and other required functionalities as per the project specifications.
5. **Test Your Code**: Write unit tests to validate the functionality of your classes and storage engine.
6. **Review and Refactor**: Continuously review and refactor your code to maintain clarity, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.
7. **Collaborate and Seek Help**: Don't hesitate to collaborate with your peers and seek assistance from mentors or online communities if you encounter challenges.

## Conclusion

By completing this step, you'll have laid a solid foundation for building your AirBnB clone project. Embrace the learning journey, stay curious, and enjoy the process of creating a functional and efficient application!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
